# AI-agent for action-RPG Path of Exile
**_Non-profit, for educational purposes only._** <br>

The final goal of the project is to create an easily adaptable product for full cycle of creating AI-agents,
that can play modern computer games while relying solely on information available from the screen capture.

## Current progress

- [x] Data gathering 
- [x] Data preparation and storage 
- [x] Model creation and training 
- [x] Model testing in-game
- [ ] Fine tuning of models
- [ ] Fully capable AI-agent 

## Explanation and usage
### General
<p> 
  Repository provides source code for everything I used to gather and prepare the dataset for training several CNN models.<br>
  Currently I am actively working on documenting what is happening here, because till now it was exposed only to small team.<br>
  I decided to not provide existing trained models, because usage of such software is against PoE's ToS. However I am planning on
  showing the actual performance in video format(this will take some time).

### Problem
  The goal is to create an AI-agent which is capable of traversing and killing enemies in procedurely generated environments inside PC game Path of Exile, 
  specifically so called maps.
